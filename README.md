### Mobile flashcards
Mobile flashcards is a web app that lets a user create groups of questions (decks), and then lets them answer those questions in a quiz. Notifications are also implemented to notify user daily about the Quiz.

## State
For this application, most of the applicationâ€™s state is managed by Redux - decks and questions.  
Internal state is maintained inside each controlled component, either by using Hooks or Class components state - Quiz View, for example.
